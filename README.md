This project conducts sentiment analysis on the Twitter and Reddit Sentimental Analysis Dataset on Kaggle, using two traditional machine learning (ML) models - Naïve Bayes and Random Forest. Sentiment analysis is important to understand public opinion about politics, business and other domains. The dataset contains tweets about the 2019 Indian General Elections relating to the next Prime Minister of the nation. The dataset contains cleaned structured data consisting of 162,980 rows and two columns – one comprising of tweets and the other of sentiment labels for each tweet. There are three labels for each possible sentiment including: “1” which indicates a tweet with a positive sentiment; “0” which indicates a tweet with a neutral sentiment; and “-1” which indicates a tweet with a negative sentiment.
